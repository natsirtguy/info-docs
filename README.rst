*A collection of info files*

Usage
-----

Download the files, then use the info reader of your choice to read
them. If you want them to show up in the info reader directory and
work correctly, try::

  $ install-info python.info
  $ cp python.info /usr/local/share/info/

This example is for installing the Python docs. Replace the directory
on the second line with the location of the info files on your system.
